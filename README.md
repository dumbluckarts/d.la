# dumbluckarts

indie development studio hosted at http://dumbluckarts.com

hey there, welcome to dumbluckarts; a non professional indie development studio
that just wants to make games. Currently our base is out of Calgary AB, Canada
and is run by just a couple of guys who love new art and design. Any projects we
release to our website are done out of love of games and want to learn this amazing
media and not for sale by any on-goers who just want to sell our stuff. All our
project folders will become available after released to give back to the community
but a donate button will be opened just in case someone wants to give back. Thanks
for stopping by.

## what is dumbluckarts?

We aren't anything special, just a bunch of dudes trying to make games and other little
projects because we like making things and enjoy creating things on our computers. We
are a studio just looking for recognition in our stuff we put out rather than our profits.
As a small development studio based out of a couple of townhomes and linked over discord
in Canada expect updates, projects, and things to be unstable and not always perfectly made.
We try our hardest and hope you understand that we don't mean anyone's computer harm and hope
that bug wasn't our fault!

## whos behind this?

the three main contributors nelsondev, inoahfella, and sir-galahad are just a bunch of dudes
who love making things on computer. We all have our own skillset and all do our own things.
