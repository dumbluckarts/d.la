FROM NOW ON, PLEASE CREATE A NEW GIT "BRANCH" FOR EVERY NEW PROJECT FOLLOWING 
THE NAMING SCHEME "proj-". AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE "proj-glitch".

- Sign into our git by vising the url at https://github.com/dumbluckarts/d.la and
clicking "clone or download." 

TO MAKE THIS PROCESS A TON BETTER - Get the Github Desktop application. Its cross
platform and really easy. All you do is sign into your github account (which I have
to add to our organization so please contact nelson@dumbluckarts.com), it'll show
a repository (if you're added to it) named d.la. Click clone after selecting a
location to save to.

    * offers the ability for us to roll back mistakes as well gives us tools for
    fixing "merge conflicts" when two or more people submit the same edits. For
    example if someone changed the word "butts" to "apple" and another changed
    it to "chris" before the other was able to commit their change it would cause
    a "merge conflict." Two changes are trying to take over at the same time.

    * this application makes it a ton easier to "pull" changes or "new versions"
    of the project you're working on as well as makes it easier to "push" your
    changes so everyone can see your work!

    * it also makes it easier to handle your personal repositories which house an
    easy location your employers to see your projects.

- To create a new git branch in the application "github desktop" signed into your
github account and on the d.la master branch look on to top 'ribbon' to the application
for the large selection box for "current branch." It should say "master." Click it,
then the button on the right named "new branch."

DO NOT EDIT THE MASTER BRANCH.
